Inventory Management System is a web based application made to track and manage product storage efficiently, preventing overstocking or stockouts.

It offers features like stock forecasting and detailed reporting, reducing manual errors and ensuring optimal stock levels.

This system also provides a built in Billing System for updating stock when products are purchased.

This project is made by me and my friends Rajnish Kumar, Neha. A. Pillai and Devika .R for our college Software Engineering miniproject conducted on our Fifth Semester.

## Shoutouts

Shoutout to my friend <a href="https://github.com/Rajnishtheone">Rajnish Kumar</a> for his contribution on the frontend and styling of this project. You may not see his contribution on the history of this repo since he done most of the work on my laptop and the commits were from my account, as we aren't that experienced with git at that time. 

Also shoutout to Neha A Pillai and Devika R for the documentation and presentaion on class.
